      "C. elegans, also known as Caenorhabditis elegans, is a species of free-living nematode (roundworm) that has become a model organism in biological research. It is a microscopic worm that measures about 1 millimeter in length and lives in soil or decaying organic matter. The name \"elegans\" refers to its slender, elegant appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "C. elegans was first isolated in the 1960s by Dr. Sydney Brenner, who recognized its potential as a model organism due to its simple body plan, short life cycle, and ease of cultivation. The worm has only three main cell types in its adult stage: nerve cells, muscle cells, and epithelial cells, making it an ideal system for studying development, genetics, and cell biology.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the key reasons C. elegans is widely used in research is its transparent body, which allows scientists to observe its internal structures and processes in real-time using microscopy techniques. Additionally, its genome was fully sequenced in 1998, making it one of the first multicellular organisms to have its entire genome mapped. This has facilitated studies on gene function, development, aging, and disease mechanisms, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer.\n",
      "\n",
